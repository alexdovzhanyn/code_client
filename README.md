### Code Client

This project is a JavaFX application that allows users to easily learn to use a programming language of their choice.

## Installation

Since JavaFX is a native java library, you won't need anything but java itself and an IDE. Use whatever IDE you want to use :)

## Dependencies (Linux)

As of the time of writing, the only external dependency that is needed is GKSU for GNU/Linux. For development, use `sudo apt-get install gksu` to install it. For
production we will need a way to include the library automatically for our Linux users

## Todos

* Update this readme
* Build the project
* Decide on licensing / whether or not we want to open source this.
